# RAG Pipeline for conversational feedback

![rag-pipeline](https://github.com/tmobley96/rag-convo/assets/124856260/3e7a9355-bc86-4848-8adc-d3f25b8a8a43)

This project showcases the creation of a conversational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline system using LangChain, designed for engaging and informative discussions about video game releases. The advanced notebook provided guides users in building a RAG that leverages a quantized Mistral-7B for efficient yet powerful information retrieval and generation. I focused on December 2023 video game releases, using data from [Gamespot's biggest game releases of December 2023](https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-biggest-game-releases-of-december-2023/2900-4962/) as a knowledge base. This project highlights key concepts in Conversational AI, offering an in-depth look at RAG and its application in creating advanced, context-aware conversational agents with LangChain.
